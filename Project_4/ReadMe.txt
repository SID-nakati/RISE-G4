This Quiz Application is a desktop-based multiple-choice quiz system built using Python’s tkinter module for the graphical interface and json for storing quiz data. The application loads a series of questions from a JSON file (questions.json) and presents them to the user one at a time, allowing navigation between questions and submission of the final answers to get a score.

Each question is displayed with four options using radio buttons, and users can select an answer before navigating forward or backward using the “Next” and “Previous” buttons. The selected answer for each question is remembered even when navigating back and forth. When the user clicks “Submit Quiz,” the application calculates the final score by comparing selected answers to the correct ones from the JSON file and then displays the result in a separate window, along with a simple exit button.

To run the quiz, users must ensure that a properly formatted questions.json file is present in the same directory as the script. The JSON file should be an array of question objects, each containing the fields: "question", "options" (a list of four strings), and "answer" (the correct option as a string). The app window is responsive and supports wrapping long questions neatly inside the window area.
