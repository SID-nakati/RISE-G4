This Weather Application is a Python-based desktop app built using the tkinter library for the graphical user interface and the requests library to fetch live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The application allows users to select or enter a city name and retrieve real-time weather information, including climate condition, temperature, and humidity. The temperature is automatically converted from Kelvin to Celsius for better user readability.

The user interface is clean and minimal, with a title label, a drop-down input box (which can be customized to pre-fill city options), and a "Get Weather" button to fetch and display the data. Once a city is selected and the user clicks the button, the app sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API using the provided API key. The response is parsed and displayed on the screen in clearly labeled sections showing the climate condition (e.g., Clear, Rainy), current temperature, and humidity level.

This project is ideal for beginners learning how to make GUI applications in Python, interact with web APIs, and parse JSON responses. To run the app, users need Python 3 and the requests module installed (pip install requests if needed). A valid API key from openweathermap.org must be inserted in the script to retrieve live data. The app runs in a fixed-size window with a light green background for a pleasant visual experience.
