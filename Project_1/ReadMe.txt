This Currency Converter is a simple desktop application developed using Python's Tkinter library. It provides an easy-to-use graphical interface that allows users to convert an entered amount from one currency to another based on predefined exchange rates. The interface includes input fields for the amount, drop-down selectors for the source and destination currencies, and a button to trigger the conversion. The result is displayed in a bold label on the screen.

The application supports conversion between seven commonly used currencies: US Dollar (USD), Indian Rupee (INR), Euro (EUR), Chinese Yuan (CNY), Japanese Yen (JPY), Russian Ruble (RUB), and British Pound (GBP). All exchange rates are hardcoded into a Python dictionary for simplicity, and the app performs a direct lookup to calculate the converted amount. It also includes basic input validation to ensure users enter a valid numerical amount and select two different currencies for conversion.

To use the converter, simply run the Python script on a system with Python 3.x installed. Tkinter comes bundled with Python, so thereâ€™s no need for additional installation. Once the program is running, you can enter an amount, choose the source and target currencies from the drop-down menus, and click the "Convert" button to view the result. If the input is invalid or a conversion rate is unavailable, appropriate error messages are shown using message boxes.
