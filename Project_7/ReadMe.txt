This Password Generator Tool is a command-line based Python application designed to quickly create strong, customizable passwords. Users can specify the desired password length and choose whether to include digits and special characters. The password is generated using Python's built-in string and random modules, ensuring secure randomness and a wide variety of characters including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and punctuation symbols.

After generating the password, users are given the option to save it to a text file (passwords.txt) for future reference. Additionally, if the pyperclip module is installed, the tool can copy the generated password directly to the clipboard, streamlining the process of using it elsewhere. Input validation is handled gracefully, and the program responds appropriately to invalid or unexpected input.

This utility is ideal for users who want a lightweight, scriptable, and highly customizable way to generate secure passwords without relying on third-party apps or web tools. Itâ€™s also a great beginner-friendly project to understand Python basics like string manipulation, file handling, and conditional logic. To run it, simply install Python and optionally pyperclip (pip install pyperclip) if clipboard functionality is desired.
