This Expense Tracker is a command-line Python application that helps users record, review, and visualize their monthly spending. Built using the standard Python libraries json, os, and datetime, along with the matplotlib library for data visualization, the application provides a lightweight and functional way to track daily expenses across different categories like food, travel, and bills. All expenses are saved locally in a file named expenses.json, ensuring persistent storage between sessions without the need for external databases.

Users can add new expenses by entering the amount, selecting a category, and specifying a date in YYYY-MM-DD format. These entries are stored as structured JSON objects in a list, allowing easy access and manipulation. The application also supports monthly summaries, where a user can input a specific month (e.g., 2025-07), and the tracker will display the total amount spent per category during that time. This helps in gaining insights into one's spending habits.

To make the data more comprehensible, the tracker includes plotting functionality using matplotlib. Users can choose between a pie chart or a bar chart to visualize the monthly spending distribution across categories. This makes it easier to identify areas of overspending and manage budgets effectively. The charts are displayed in a separate window with appropriate labels and formatting for clarity.

To use this application, the user must have Python 3 installed, along with the matplotlib library (pip install matplotlib if needed). The script can be run from a terminal or command prompt. Upon launching, users are presented with a menu to add an expense, view a summary, or generate visual plots. The design is intuitive and minimalistic, making it ideal for beginners or anyone looking for a simple local expense management tool.
