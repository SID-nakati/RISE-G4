his Task Manager is a simple command-line based application built using Python. It allows users to manage a personal to-do list with functionality to add, view, edit, mark, and delete tasks. The application stores all task data in a local JSON file (tasks.json), making it persistent between sessions without the need for a database. Each task contains a title, priority level (High, Medium, or Low), due date, and a completion status which can be toggled on or off.

The program provides a clear and interactive menu system that prompts users to choose options such as viewing all tasks, adding a new task, editing task details, marking tasks as done/undone, and deleting tasks. The display shows each task with a serial number, checkmark for completion, priority level, and due date for easy tracking. Users are guided through each action with helpful prompts and validation for incorrect inputs.

This project is perfect for beginners to practice file I/O, list and dictionary manipulation, and basic Python logic. It uses only built-in Python modules like json, os, and datetime, so no external dependencies are required. To run the app, simply execute the script with Python 3 installed. The interface runs entirely in the terminal, keeping it lightweight and accessible from any platform.
